Web Traffic Generator
=====================

## 1. Description of the software
This tool takes as input a list of web pages and visits them by means of Selenium Web Browser (relying on Firefox).
It produces as output the HARs generated by each page.
HAR is the [HTTP Archive](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/), a JSON data structure containing 
information and performance statistics about the webpage download.

## 2. Dependencies
You must install Selenium python3 package:
```
sudo pip3 install selenium
```
If you don't have pip3 istalled, you can do it following 
[this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6587507/how-to-install-pip-with-python-3) link.

Then, you must download the Har Export Trigger extension for Firerfox, available [here](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-export-trigger/).
You must only download the *.xpi file; you don't need to install the extension in your Firefox.

## 3. Usage
To run this tool, you must execute this command line:
```
web_traffic_generator.py [-h] [-b max_backoff] [-t timeout] [--headers]
                                [-s start_page]
                                input_file output_dir har_export
```

positional arguments:
*  `input_file`            File where are stored the pages, one per row
*  `output_dir`            Output directory where HAR files are saved, one for each page.
*  `har_export`            Path to Har Export extension xpi file, downloaded in the previous step.

optional arguments:
 *  `-h, --help`            show this help message and exit
 *  `-b max_backoff, --backoff max_backoff`
                        Use real backoff with maximum <max_backoff> threshold
 *  `-t timeout, --timeout timeout`
                        Timeout in seconds after declaring failed a visit.
                        Default is 30.


## 4. Output format
This tool creates an output file where it stores the output HAR of each requested URL.
For each input URL, the corresponding HAR file created in the provided directory.
The name of the HAR file reflects the time when the visit was performed and requested domain  (e.g., `visit_2016_06_15_13_41_22_www_google_it.har`).
Some HAR could be missing, due to failed downloads (very slow pages, crashed browser ecc...)
